# Chapter 16: Replenishment

**Contract Reference:** `operations/replenishment/`

## Automating Your Inventory Strategy

Picture this: You're managing inventory for hundreds of products across multiple locations, each with different demand patterns, lead times, and supplier relationships. Some items move fast, others slowly. Some are critical for customer orders, others are routine maintenance supplies. How do you ensure you always have the right inventory at the right time without tying up excessive capital or risking stockouts?

This is where intelligent replenishment comes in. Replenishment transforms inventory management from reactive firefighting into proactive, strategic planning that optimizes service levels while minimizing carrying costs. It's the difference between constantly scrambling to find inventory and having a systematic approach that anticipates needs and automates procurement decisions.

But effective replenishment is complex, involving demand forecasting, lead time management, safety stock optimization, supplier performance analysis, and continuous improvement. Poor replenishment leads to stockouts, excess inventory, emergency purchases, and customer dissatisfaction. Excellent replenishment creates competitive advantages through superior service levels, optimized working capital, and operational efficiency.

Understanding how to design and manage replenishment systems effectively—from rule configuration through performance optimization—is essential for inventory excellence and business success. This chapter will show you how to master replenishment as both an operational necessity and a strategic capability.

## Replenishment Rules

Replenishment rules provide the intelligence that drives automatic inventory planning and procurement decisions.

**Creating and Managing Rulesets**

Replenishment rulesets define the logic that determines when and how much to order for each product and location combination.

**Rule components:**
- **Reorder point** - Inventory level that triggers replenishment
- **Order quantity** - How much to order when triggered
- **Safety stock** - Buffer inventory for demand variability
- **Lead time** - Expected time from order to receipt
- **Demand forecast** - Expected future consumption
- **Service level** - Target fill rate or stockout probability

**Ruleset creation process:**
1. **Analyze demand patterns** - Historical consumption and trends
2. **Assess supply characteristics** - Lead times and variability
3. **Define service objectives** - Target service levels by product class
4. **Calculate parameters** - Reorder points and order quantities
5. **Configure rules** - Set up automated triggers and actions
6. **Test and validate** - Simulate performance before activation

**Example ruleset configuration:**
```
Replenishment Ruleset: RS-2025-001
Product Category: Control Modules
Location: Main Warehouse
Service Level Target: 95%

Rule Parameters:
- Reorder Point: 45 units
- Order Quantity: 100 units (EOQ)
- Safety Stock: 15 units
- Lead Time: 14 days (average)
- Review Period: Daily
- Supplier: Precision Components LLC

Calculation Basis:
- Average Demand: 2.5 units/day
- Demand Variability: 0.8 units (std dev)
- Lead Time Variability: 3 days (std dev)
- Service Factor: 1.65 (95% service level)

Safety Stock = Service Factor × √(Lead Time × Demand Variance + Average Demand² × Lead Time Variance)
Safety Stock = 1.65 × √(14 × 0.64 + 6.25 × 9) = 15 units

Reorder Point = (Average Demand × Lead Time) + Safety Stock
Reorder Point = (2.5 × 14) + 15 = 45 units
```

**Rule types and strategies:**
- **Min/Max rules** - Simple reorder point and maximum stock level
- **EOQ rules** - Economic order quantity optimization
- **Periodic review** - Fixed review periods with variable order quantities
- **Kanban rules** - Visual signals for replenishment triggers
- **Demand-driven** - Dynamic adjustment based on actual consumption
- **Seasonal rules** - Adjustments for seasonal demand patterns

**Activating and Deactivating Rules**

Rule activation controls when replenishment logic is applied to inventory management.

**Activation process:**
1. **Validate rule parameters** - Ensure calculations are correct
2. **Check data requirements** - Verify demand history and lead times
3. **Test rule logic** - Simulate performance with historical data
4. **Set activation date** - When rule becomes effective
5. **Monitor initial performance** - Track results after activation
6. **Adjust if needed** - Fine-tune parameters based on results

**Deactivation scenarios:**
- **Product discontinuation** - No longer need to replenish
- **Supplier changes** - Different lead times or terms
- **Seasonal adjustments** - Temporary rule modifications
- **Performance issues** - Rule not meeting service objectives
- **Strategic changes** - Different inventory strategy

## Common Questions & Troubleshooting

### "How do I set the right reorder point for my products?"

Calculate reorder points using this formula:
**Reorder Point = (Average Demand × Lead Time) + Safety Stock**

Consider these factors:
- **Demand variability** - Higher variability needs more safety stock
- **Lead time variability** - Unreliable suppliers need higher reorder points
- **Service level target** - Higher service levels require more safety stock
- **Cost of stockouts** - Critical items need higher reorder points

Start with 95% service level and adjust based on business impact.

### "What's the difference between reorder point and safety stock?"

**Safety stock** is buffer inventory for uncertainty. **Reorder point** is when to order.

- **Safety Stock**: Protection against demand/lead time variability
- **Reorder Point**: Trigger level that includes safety stock

Think of safety stock as insurance, and reorder point as the alarm that tells you to reorder.

### "How often should I review and update replenishment rules?"

Review frequency depends on business dynamics:

- **Fast-moving items**: Monthly review
- **Seasonal items**: Before each season
- **New products**: Weekly for first 3 months
- **Stable items**: Quarterly review
- **All rules**: Annual comprehensive review

Monitor performance continuously and adjust when service levels fall below targets.

### "What if my demand forecasts are always wrong?"

Improve forecast accuracy systematically:

1. **Check data quality** - Ensure clean, complete historical data
2. **Choose right method** - Match forecasting method to demand pattern
3. **Consider external factors** - Seasonality, promotions, market changes
4. **Measure and improve** - Track forecast error and adjust methods
5. **Accept uncertainty** - Use safety stock to buffer forecast errors

Focus on reducing forecast error rather than eliminating it completely.

### "How do I handle seasonal demand patterns?"

Manage seasonality through adaptive rules:

- **Seasonal forecasting** - Use methods that capture seasonal patterns
- **Dynamic safety stock** - Adjust safety stock by season
- **Seasonal reorder points** - Higher points before peak seasons
- **Supplier coordination** - Share seasonal forecasts for capacity planning
- **Inventory buildup** - Plan inventory increases before peak periods

Start planning seasonal adjustments 2-3 months in advance.

### "What if my supplier lead times are unreliable?"

Address lead time variability:

1. **Measure variability** - Calculate standard deviation of lead times
2. **Increase safety stock** - Buffer for lead time uncertainty
3. **Develop alternatives** - Backup suppliers with better reliability
4. **Improve communication** - Regular supplier performance discussions
5. **Consider expediting** - Premium service for critical items

Factor lead time variability into your reorder point calculations.

### "How do I balance service levels with inventory costs?"

Optimize the service level vs. cost trade-off:

- **Classify products** - Different service levels by importance (ABC analysis)
- **Calculate total cost** - Carrying cost + stockout cost + ordering cost
- **Use economic models** - EOQ and service level optimization
- **Monitor performance** - Track both service and cost metrics
- **Adjust gradually** - Make incremental changes and measure impact

Start with 95% service level for A items, 90% for B items, 85% for C items.

### "Can I automate replenishment completely?"

Automate systematically with proper controls:

**Good candidates for automation**:
- High-volume, stable demand items
- Reliable suppliers with consistent lead times
- Standard products with established rules

**Keep manual control for**:
- New products without demand history
- High-value or critical items
- Items with erratic demand patterns
- Strategic supplier relationships

Start with 20% automation and gradually increase as confidence builds.

### "What metrics should I track for replenishment performance?"

Key metrics to monitor:

**Service Metrics**:
- Service level (% demand filled from stock)
- Fill rate (% orders filled completely)
- Stockout frequency and duration

**Efficiency Metrics**:
- Inventory turns
- Days of inventory on hand
- Carrying cost percentage

**Quality Metrics**:
- Forecast accuracy (MAPE)
- Rule performance (% meeting targets)
- Supplier performance (on-time delivery)

Track trends over time and benchmark against industry standards.

### "How do I handle new products without demand history?"

Manage new product replenishment carefully:

1. **Use analogous products** - Similar items as demand proxies
2. **Start conservative** - Higher safety stock initially
3. **Monitor closely** - Weekly reviews for first 3 months
4. **Adjust quickly** - Rapid parameter updates based on actual demand
5. **Supplier coordination** - Close communication for capacity and lead times

Expect higher inventory investment initially, then optimize as data accumulates.
