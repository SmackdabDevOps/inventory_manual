# Chapter 25: Service Management

**Contract Reference:** `operations/service-management/paths/service-item-core.yaml`, `operations/service-management/paths/work-order-core.yaml`

## Managing Services as Inventory

Picture this: Your business doesn't just sell products—you also provide installation services, maintenance contracts, training programs, and technical support. These services need to be tracked, scheduled, billed, and managed just like physical inventory. How do you handle service capacity, track labor consumption, manage work orders, and ensure profitability across both products and services?

This is where service management comes in. Service management extends inventory principles to intangible services, treating service capacity as inventory that can be allocated, consumed, and replenished. It's the difference between managing products only and managing complete customer solutions.

But service management is more than just scheduling—it involves service catalog management, capacity planning, work order execution, resource allocation, and performance tracking. Poor service management leads to overcommitted resources, missed deadlines, unprofitable services, and customer dissatisfaction. Excellent service management creates competitive advantages through reliable service delivery, optimized resource utilization, and integrated product-service offerings.

Understanding how to design and manage service operations effectively—from service definition through work order completion—is essential for businesses that combine products and services into comprehensive customer solutions. This chapter will show you how to master service management as both an operational capability and a strategic differentiator.

### Quick Confidence Check

  :answer-index="0"
  :explanations="[&quot;Stocking the vehicle prevents onsite delays.&quot;, &quot;CRM preferences are unrelated to readiness.&quot;, &quot;Changing the SLA erodes trust and does not solve readiness.&quot;]"

**Capacity Planning and Management**

Capacity planning ensures service delivery capabilities match customer demand while maintaining profitability and quality standards.

**Capacity planning process:**
1. **Analyze demand patterns** - Historical and projected service demand
2. **Assess resource availability** - Staff, equipment, and facility capacity
3. **Calculate capacity requirements** - Hours, skills, and timing needs
4. **Identify capacity gaps** - Shortfalls and surpluses
5. **Develop capacity plans** - Hiring, training, and resource allocation
6. **Monitor utilization** - Track actual vs. planned capacity usage

**Capacity management framework:**
```
Service Capacity Management:

Resource Capacity Analysis:
Technical Consultants:
- Available: 5 consultants × 40 hours/week = 200 hours/week
- Billable target: 75% = 150 billable hours/week
- Current utilization: 85% = 170 hours/week
- Status: Over-utilized (need additional consultant)

Field Technicians:
- Available: 8 technicians × 40 hours/week = 320 hours/week
- Billable target: 80% = 256 billable hours/week
- Current utilization: 70% = 224 hours/week
- Status: Under-utilized (capacity available)

Support Staff:
- Available: 12 staff × 40 hours/week = 480 hours/week
- Coverage target: 24×7 = 168 hours/week coverage
- Current coverage: 24×5 = 120 hours/week
- Status: Gap in weekend coverage

Capacity Planning by Service:

Gold Support Plan:
- Contracted capacity: 50 customers × 120 hours = 6,000 hours/year
- Available capacity: 3 senior technicians × 1,500 hours = 4,500 hours/year
- Capacity gap: 1,500 hours (need 1 additional technician)

Installation Services:
- Projected demand: 200 installations/year × 4 hours = 800 hours/year
- Available capacity: 8 technicians × 25% allocation = 1,600 hours/year
- Capacity surplus: 800 hours (can handle growth)

Training Services:
- Contracted training: 150 sessions/year × 8 hours = 1,200 hours/year
- Available capacity: 2 trainers × 1,000 hours = 2,000 hours/year
- Capacity surplus: 800 hours (can expand offerings)

Capacity Optimization Actions:
1. Hire 1 additional senior technician for Gold Support
2. Cross-train field technicians for weekend support coverage
3. Develop junior consultants to reduce senior consultant load
4. Implement self-service options to reduce support demand
5. Optimize scheduling to improve utilization rates
