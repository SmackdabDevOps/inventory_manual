# Chapter 26: Inventory Valuation

**Contract Reference:** `operations/valuation/paths/costing-core.yaml`, `operations/valuation/paths/cost-layer-core.yaml`

## Getting the Numbers Right

Picture this: Your CFO needs accurate inventory values for the quarterly financial statements. Your tax accountant requires FIFO costing for compliance. Your operations manager wants to understand the true cost of goods sold. Your controller is investigating cost variances that don't make sense. Each stakeholder needs different views of the same inventory, but all require absolute accuracy. How do you maintain precise inventory valuations across multiple costing methods while ensuring audit compliance and operational insight?

This is where inventory valuation comes in. Valuation transforms physical inventory quantities into financial values that support decision-making, compliance, and strategic planning. It's the difference between knowing what you have and knowing what it's worth.

But inventory valuation is more than just applying unit costs—it involves costing method selection, cost layer management, variance analysis, and regulatory compliance. Poor valuation practices lead to financial misstatements, tax issues, audit failures, and poor business decisions. Excellent valuation practices create competitive advantages through accurate financial reporting, precise cost management, and strategic insights.

Understanding how to design and manage inventory valuation effectively—from costing method selection through variance analysis—is essential for financial accuracy and business success. This chapter will show you how to master inventory valuation as both a financial discipline and a strategic capability.

## Costing Methods and Standards

Inventory costing methods determine how costs are assigned to inventory and cost of goods sold, impacting financial statements and business decisions.

**Costing Method Selection**

Different costing methods serve different business needs and regulatory requirements.

**Primary costing methods:**
- **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)** - Oldest costs assigned to COGS first
- **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out)** - Newest costs assigned to COGS first
- **Weighted Average** - Average cost across all inventory
- **Standard Cost** - Predetermined costs with variance analysis
- **Specific Identification** - Actual costs for specific items

**Costing method characteristics:**
```
Costing Method Comparison:

FIFO (First-In, First-Out):
- Cost flow: Oldest costs to COGS first
- Inventory value: Recent costs (higher in inflation)
- COGS: Older costs (lower in inflation)
- Tax impact: Higher taxes in inflationary periods
- Best for: Perishable goods, regulatory compliance
- Complexity: Moderate (cost layer tracking)

LIFO (Last-In, First-Out):
- Cost flow: Newest costs to COGS first
- Inventory value: Older costs (lower in inflation)
- COGS: Recent costs (higher in inflation)
- Tax impact: Lower taxes in inflationary periods
- Best for: Non-perishable goods, tax optimization
- Complexity: High (cost layer management)

Weighted Average:
- Cost flow: Average of all costs
- Inventory value: Smoothed cost fluctuations
- COGS: Average costs
- Tax impact: Moderate, stable
- Best for: Commodity products, simplicity
- Complexity: Low (single average cost)

Standard Cost:
- Cost flow: Predetermined standard costs
- Inventory value: Standard costs
- COGS: Standard costs plus variances
- Tax impact: Requires variance adjustments
- Best for: Manufacturing, cost control
- Complexity: High (variance analysis required)

Specific Identification:
- Cost flow: Actual costs for specific items
- Inventory value: Actual costs
- COGS: Actual costs
- Tax impact: Actual cost basis
- Best for: Unique, high-value items
- Complexity: Very high (individual tracking)
```

**Standard Cost Management**

Standard costing uses predetermined costs with systematic variance analysis to support cost control and performance measurement.

**Standard cost components:**
- **Material costs** - Standard prices for raw materials and components
- **Labor costs** - Standard rates and efficiency factors
- **Overhead costs** - Allocated facility and support costs
- **Variance analysis** - Differences between standard and actual costs

**Standard cost development process:**
1. **Analyze historical costs** - Review past performance and trends
2. **Assess current conditions** - Market prices, labor rates, efficiency
3. **Project future costs** - Expected changes and improvements
4. **Set standard costs** - Establish targets for the period
5. **Monitor variances** - Track actual vs. standard performance
6. **Update standards** - Revise based on significant changes

**Example standard cost structure:**
```

## Variance Analysis and Management

Variance analysis identifies and investigates differences between expected and actual costs to support cost control and process improvement.

**Types of Cost Variances**

Cost variances occur in multiple categories, each requiring different analysis and corrective actions.

**Variance categories:**
```
Cost Variance Framework:

Material Variances:
Price Variance:
- Formula: (Actual Price - Standard Price) × Actual Quantity
- Causes: Market price changes, supplier changes, quality differences
- Responsibility: Purchasing department
- Example: Actual $46.00 vs Standard $45.00 × 100 units = $100 unfavorable

Quantity Variance:
- Formula: (Actual Quantity - Standard Quantity) × Standard Price
- Causes: Waste, efficiency, quality issues, design changes
- Responsibility: Production department
- Example: Actual 105 units vs Standard 100 units × $45.00 = $225 unfavorable

Labor Variances:
Rate Variance:
- Formula: (Actual Rate - Standard Rate) × Actual Hours
- Causes: Wage changes, skill mix, overtime premium
- Responsibility: Human resources, production scheduling
- Example: Actual $26.50 vs Standard $25.00 × 75 hours = $112.50 unfavorable

Efficiency Variance:
- Formula: (Actual Hours - Standard Hours) × Standard Rate
- Causes: Training, equipment, process changes, motivation
- Responsibility: Production management
- Example: Actual 80 hours vs Standard 75 hours × $25.00 = $125 unfavorable

Overhead Variances:
Spending Variance:
- Formula: Actual Overhead - Budgeted Overhead
- Causes: Cost control, volume changes, price changes
- Responsibility: Department managers
- Example: Actual $38,000 vs Budget $35,000 = $3,000 unfavorable

Volume Variance:
- Formula: (Standard Hours - Budgeted Hours) × Fixed Overhead Rate
- Causes: Production volume differences from budget
- Responsibility: Sales and production planning
- Example: Standard 950 hours vs Budget 1,000 hours × $15 = $750 unfavorable
```

**Variance Investigation Process**

Variance investigation determines root causes and implements corrective actions to prevent future occurrences.

**Investigation criteria:**
- **Materiality threshold** - Dollar amount or percentage significance
- **Trend analysis** - Recurring or increasing variances

**GAAP Compliance Requirements**

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) establish standards for inventory valuation and reporting.

**Key GAAP requirements:**
```
GAAP Inventory Valuation Requirements:

Lower of Cost or Net Realizable Value (LCNRV):
- Inventory must be valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value
- Net realizable value = Estimated selling price - costs to complete and sell
- Write-downs required when NRV < cost
- Write-downs cannot be reversed

Cost Components:
Included in Inventory Cost:
- Purchase price of materials
- Conversion costs (labor and overhead)
- Transportation and handling costs
- Import duties and taxes
- Storage costs (if necessary for production)

Excluded from Inventory Cost:
- Selling expenses
- General administrative expenses
- Storage costs (if not necessary)
- Interest expense (unless qualifying asset)
