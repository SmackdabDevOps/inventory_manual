# Chapter 21: Transformations

**Contract Reference:** `operations/transformations/paths/transformation-core.yaml`

## Changing Products to Create Value

Picture this: You receive raw coffee beans and need to transform them into different roast levels and package sizes for retail sale. Or you have bulk chemicals that need to be repackaged into smaller containers for different customer segments. Maybe you need to upgrade electronic components with new firmware or modify products to meet specific customer requirements. How do you manage these transformation processes while maintaining accurate inventory, cost tracking, and quality control?

This is where inventory transformations come in. Transformations enable you to modify, process, repackage, or upgrade existing inventory to create new products or variants that meet specific market needs. It's the difference between being limited to what you purchase and being able to create exactly what your customers want.

But transformations are more than just changing products—they involve bill of materials management, process control, cost allocation, yield tracking, and quality assurance. Poor transformation management leads to cost overruns, quality issues, inventory inaccuracies, and customer dissatisfaction. Excellent transformation management creates competitive advantages through product customization, value-added services, and operational flexibility.

Understanding how to design and manage transformation operations effectively—from BOM definition through execution and variance management—is essential for businesses that add value through processing, modification, or customization. This chapter will show you how to master transformations as both an operational capability and a strategic advantage.

## Transformation Fundamentals

Transformations provide systematic processes for converting input materials into different output products through controlled operations that maintain inventory accuracy and cost traceability.

**Types of Transformations**

Different transformation types serve different business purposes and operational requirements.

**Transformation categories:**
- **Repackaging** - Changing package sizes or configurations
- **Processing** - Manufacturing or chemical processes
- **Assembly** - Combining components into finished products
- **Breakdown** - Separating products into components
- **Grade change** - Modifying quality or specification levels
- **Other** - Custom transformation types

**Transformation applications:**
```
Transformation Type Examples:

Repackaging:
- Bulk chemicals → Small containers
- Large packages → Individual units
- Multi-packs → Single items
- Private labeling operations

Processing:
- Raw materials → Finished goods
- Coffee beans → Roasted coffee
- Raw steel → Machined parts
- Chemical mixing operations

Assembly:
- Components → Finished products

```

**Creating Transformation BOMs**

Transformation BOMs (Bills of Materials) define the inputs, outputs, and processes required for transformation operations.

**BOM components:**
- **Input materials** - Products consumed in transformation
- **Output products** - Products created by transformation
- **Process parameters** - Time, temperature, procedures
