# Chapter 19: Cycle Counting and Physical Inventory

**Contract Reference:** `operations/counting/paths/counting-core.yaml`

## Keeping Your Inventory Accurate

Picture this: Your system shows 150 units of a critical component, but when a customer places an urgent order, you discover there are only 89 units on the shelf. Or imagine preparing for your annual audit and finding thousands of dollars in inventory discrepancies that could have been caught and corrected months ago. How do you maintain accurate inventory records without shutting down operations for days at a time?

This is where cycle counting and physical inventory come in. These processes transform inventory accuracy from an annual event into an ongoing discipline that maintains system integrity while supporting daily operations. It's the difference between hoping your inventory is accurate and knowing it is accurate.

But inventory counting is more than just comparing numbers—it's about systematic accuracy, operational discipline, and continuous improvement. Poor counting practices lead to stockouts, excess inventory, customer dissatisfaction, and audit failures. Excellent counting practices create competitive advantages through superior availability, optimized working capital, and operational confidence.

Understanding how to design and execute counting programs effectively—from cycle counting strategies through full physical inventories—is essential for inventory accuracy and business success. This chapter will show you how to master inventory counting as both an operational necessity and a strategic capability.

## Common Questions & Troubleshooting

### "How often should I perform cycle counts?"

Cycle count frequency depends on item characteristics and business requirements:

**A Items (High value/volume)**: Weekly or bi-weekly
**B Items (Medium value/volume)**: Monthly
**C Items (Low value/volume)**: Quarterly

**Factors to consider**:
- Item value and criticality
- Transaction frequency
- Historical accuracy
- Regulatory requirements
- Available resources

Start with ABC classification and adjust based on performance.

### "What's the difference between blind and non-blind counts?"

**Blind counts** don't show system quantities to counters, **non-blind counts** do:

**Blind Count Benefits**:
- Eliminates counting bias
- Improves accuracy
- Better variance detection
- Audit compliance

**Non-Blind Count Benefits**:
- Faster counting
- Immediate variance detection
- Less training required
- Better for spot counts

Use blind counts for formal accuracy programs, non-blind for operational verification.

### "How do I handle variances during counts?"

Handle variances systematically:

1. **Immediate verification** - Recount to confirm variance
2. **Classification** - Determine variance type and magnitude
3. **Investigation** - Research root cause
4. **Resolution** - Correct system or process issues
5. **Documentation** - Record findings and actions

Set variance thresholds for automatic investigation (e.g., >5% or >$100).

### "What if I find inventory in the wrong location?"

Handle misplaced inventory properly:

1. **Don't move items during count** - Count where found
2. **Document actual location** - Record where items were discovered
3. **Investigate after count** - Determine why items were misplaced
4. **Process location transfer** - Move items to correct location
5. **Update system records** - Reflect actual locations

Focus on accuracy first, then correct locations.

### "How do I minimize business disruption during counts?"

Reduce operational impact:

**Scheduling**:
- Count during low-activity periods
- Use partial location freezes
- Coordinate with operations

**Methods**:
- Cycle counting vs. full shutdowns
- Zone-based counting
- Quick count techniques

**Communication**:
- Advance notice to operations
- Clear freeze procedures
- Rapid variance resolution

Balance accuracy needs with operational requirements.

### "What equipment do I need for effective counting?"

Essential counting equipment:

**Basic Requirements**:
- Mobile scanners or tablets
- Backup count sheets
- Calculators
- Clipboards and pens

**Advanced Options**:
- RFID readers
- Voice-directed systems
- Automated counting scales
- Drone technology (for high locations)

Start with mobile scanners and expand based on ROI and complexity.

### "How do I train staff for accurate counting?"

Implement comprehensive training:

**Training Components**:
- Counting procedures and standards
- Equipment operation
- Variance investigation
- Safety requirements
- Quality standards

**Training Methods**:
- Hands-on practice
- Shadowing experienced counters
- Regular refresher sessions
- Performance feedback
- Certification programs

Focus on accuracy over speed initially.

### "What variance thresholds should I set?"

Set thresholds based on item characteristics:

**By Item Class**:
- A Items: 1-2%
- B Items: 3-5%
- C Items: 5-10%

**By Value**:
- High value: $100
- Medium value: $250
- Low value: $500

**Consider**:
- Item cost and criticality
- Historical accuracy
- Investigation resources
- Audit requirements

Adjust thresholds based on performance and resources.

### "How do I measure counting program success?"

Key performance indicators:

**Accuracy Metrics**:
- Overall accuracy percentage
- Accuracy by item class
- Accuracy by location
- Variance trends

**Efficiency Metrics**:
- Counts per hour
- Investigation time
- Resolution rate
- Cost per count

**Business Impact**:
- Stockout reduction
- Customer satisfaction
- Audit results
- Financial accuracy

Track trends and benchmark against industry standards.

### "What if my physical inventory results are significantly off?"

Handle major discrepancies systematically:

1. **Stop and investigate** - Don't proceed until understood
2. **Verify count procedures** - Ensure proper execution
3. **Check cutoff procedures** - Confirm transaction freeze
4. **Review high-value variances** - Focus on significant items
5. **Consider recount** - If procedures were flawed
6. **Document thoroughly** - For audit and improvement

Major variances often indicate process issues rather than actual losses.
