# Chapter 22: Analytics and Business Intelligence

**Contract Reference:** `operations/analytics/paths/metrics-core.yaml`

## Turning Data into Strategic Insights

Picture this: You have thousands of inventory transactions happening daily across multiple locations, but you're making decisions based on gut feeling and outdated spreadsheets. You know your inventory turnover "seems slow" and your stockouts "feel frequent," but you can't quantify the impact or identify the root causes. How do you transform all that operational data into actionable insights that drive better business decisions?

This is where analytics and business intelligence come in. Analytics transforms raw inventory data into meaningful metrics, trends, and insights that enable data-driven decision making. It's the difference between hoping your inventory strategy is working and knowing exactly how it's performing.

But analytics is more than just generating reports—it's about identifying patterns, predicting trends, measuring performance against targets, and providing the insights needed for strategic planning. Poor analytics leads to reactive management, missed opportunities, and suboptimal performance. Excellent analytics creates competitive advantages through informed decision-making, proactive management, and continuous optimization.

Understanding how to design and use analytics effectively—from basic metrics through advanced business intelligence—is essential for inventory excellence and strategic success. This chapter will show you how to master analytics as both an operational tool and a strategic capability.

## Analytics Fundamentals

Analytics provides the measurement, analysis, and insights needed to understand inventory performance and drive continuous improvement.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

KPIs provide standardized measurements that enable performance tracking and benchmarking across time periods and business units.

**Essential inventory KPIs:**
- **Inventory Accuracy** - Percentage of items with correct quantities
- **Inventory Turnover** - How quickly inventory converts to sales
- **Fill Rate** - Percentage of orders filled completely from stock
- **Stockout Rate** - Frequency and duration of out-of-stock events
- **Days of Inventory** - How many days of demand current inventory represents
- **Carrying Cost** - Total cost of holding inventory
- **Service Level** - Percentage of demand met from available stock

**KPI characteristics:**
```
Effective KPI Design:

Inventory Accuracy:
- Formula: (Items without variance / Total items counted) × 100
- Target: 98% or higher
- Frequency: Monthly (cycle counts)
- Benchmark: Industry standard 95-99%
- Action threshold: <96% requires investigation

Inventory Turnover:
- Formula: Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory Value
- Target: 6-12 turns per year (varies by industry)
- Frequency: Monthly calculation
- Benchmark: Industry and product category specific
- Action threshold: <50% of target requires action

Fill Rate:
- Formula: (Orders filled completely / Total orders) × 100
- Target: 95% or higher
- Frequency: Daily monitoring
- Benchmark: Best-in-class 98%+
- Action threshold: <92% requires immediate action

Stockout Rate:
- Formula: (SKUs out of stock / Total active SKUs) × 100
- Target: <2% of SKUs
- Frequency: Daily monitoring
- Benchmark: Industry standard 1-5%
- Action threshold: >5% requires escalation
```

**Metrics Collection and Calculation**

Metrics collection involves gathering data from operational systems and calculating meaningful performance indicators.

**Data sources:**
- **Transaction systems** - Receipts, shipments, adjustments
- **Order management** - Customer orders and fulfillment
- **Inventory systems** - Stock levels and movements
- **Financial systems** - Costs and valuations
- **Quality systems** - Accuracy and compliance data
- **External systems** - Supplier and customer data

**Calculation methods:**
```
Metric Calculation Examples:

Inventory Accuracy Calculation:
Data Sources:
- Cycle count results
- Physical inventory results
- System inventory records

Calculation:
Total Items Counted: 1,250
Items with Variance: 23
Accuracy = (1,250 - 23) / 1,250 × 100 = 98.16%

Trend Analysis:
- January: 97.8%
- February: 98.1%
- March: 98.16%
- Trend: Improving (+0.36% over 3 months)

Inventory Turnover Calculation:
Data Sources:
- Cost of goods sold (from financial system)
- Average inventory value (from inventory system)

Calculation:
Annual COGS: $2,400,000
Average Inventory Value: $400,000
Turnover = $2,400,000 / $400,000 = 6.0 turns

Monthly Analysis:
- Q1 Average: $420,000 (5.7 turns)
- Q2 Average: $380,000 (6.3 turns)
- Q3 Average: $400,000 (6.0 turns)
- Trend: Stabilizing around target
```

## Common Questions & Troubleshooting

### "What KPIs should I track for inventory management?"

Focus on KPIs that drive business results:

**Essential KPIs**:
- Inventory accuracy (98%+ target)
- Fill rate (95%+ target)
- Inventory turnover (industry-specific)
- Stockout rate (<2% target)
- Days of inventory (30-90 days typical)

**Advanced KPIs**:
- Forecast accuracy
- Supplier performance
- Carrying cost percentage
- Obsolescence rate
- Service level by customer segment

Start with 5-7 core KPIs and expand based on maturity and needs.

### "How often should I update my analytics and dashboards?"

Update frequency depends on the metric and audience:

**Real-time**: Critical operational metrics (stockouts, order status)
**Daily**: Operational dashboards and alerts
**Weekly**: Management reporting and trend analysis
**Monthly**: Strategic KPIs and benchmarking
**Quarterly**: Comprehensive performance reviews

Balance timeliness with data quality and system performance.

### "What's the difference between reporting and analytics?"

**Reporting** tells you what happened, **analytics** tells you why and what might happen:

**Reporting**:
- Historical data presentation
- Standard formats and schedules
- Descriptive statistics
- Compliance and audit support

**Analytics**:
- Pattern identification and insights
- Predictive and prescriptive analysis
- Root cause investigation
- Strategic decision support

Use reporting for operational control and analytics for strategic advantage.

### "How do I ensure data quality for analytics?"

Implement systematic data quality management:

**Data Quality Dimensions**:
- Completeness (all required data present)
- Accuracy (data reflects reality)
- Consistency (data agrees across systems)
- Timeliness (data is current)
- Validity (data meets business rules)

**Quality Controls**:
- Automated validation rules
- Regular data audits
- Source system monitoring
- Exception reporting
- Data governance processes

### "What tools do I need for inventory analytics?"

Tool requirements depend on complexity and budget:

**Basic Analytics**:
