# Chapter 28: API Integration

**Contract Reference:** `shared/schemas/envelope.yaml`, `shared/parameters.yaml`, `shared/hooks.yaml`

## Connecting Your World

Picture this: Your inventory system needs to talk to your ERP, your e-commerce platform, your warehouse management system, your accounting software, and your customer portal. Each system has different data formats, authentication methods, and integration patterns. Your customers expect real-time inventory updates across all channels. Your operations team needs seamless data flow between systems. How do you create reliable, scalable integrations that keep all your systems synchronized while maintaining data integrity and system performance?

This is where API integration comes in. API integration provides the systematic approaches and technical patterns needed to connect inventory management with external systems while ensuring data consistency, security, and operational reliability. It's the difference between isolated systems and a unified business platform.

But API integration is more than just connecting systems—it involves authentication and security, data transformation and mapping, error handling and resilience, and performance optimization. Poor integration practices lead to data inconsistencies, system failures, security vulnerabilities, and operational disruptions. Excellent integration practices create competitive advantages through seamless data flow, automated processes, and unified customer experiences.

Understanding how to design and implement API integrations effectively—from authentication through monitoring—is essential for modern business operations. This chapter will show you how to master API integration as both a technical capability and a strategic enabler.

## API Architecture and Design

API architecture and design establish the foundation for reliable, scalable, and maintainable integrations between inventory management and external systems.

**RESTful API Principles**

RESTful APIs provide a standardized approach to system integration using HTTP protocols and resource-based design patterns.

**Core REST principles:**
- **Resource-based URLs** - Clear, hierarchical resource identification
- **HTTP methods** - Standard verbs for different operations
- **Stateless communication** - Each request contains complete information
- **Standard status codes** - Consistent response indicators
- **JSON data format** - Lightweight, readable data exchange

**API design patterns:**
```
RESTful API Design Patterns:

Resource Identification:
Base URL: https://api.inventory.smackdab.com/v1

Product Resources:
GET    /products                    # List all products
GET    /products/{product_id}       # Get specific product
POST   /products                    # Create new product
PUT    /products/{product_id}       # Update product
DELETE /products/{product_id}       # Delete product

Inventory Resources:
GET    /inventory/locations         # List locations
GET    /inventory/locations/{location_id}/products  # Products at location
POST   /inventory/transactions      # Create transaction
GET    /inventory/transactions/{transaction_id}     # Get transaction

Nested Resources:
GET    /products/{product_id}/inventory             # Product inventory
GET    /locations/{location_id}/inventory           # Location inventory
POST   /allocations/{allocation_id}/releases        # Release allocation

Query Parameters:
GET /products?category=electronics&status=active
GET /inventory/transactions?start_date=2025-01-01&end_date=2025-01-31
GET /allocations?priority=high&status=pending

Filtering and Pagination:
GET /products?filters[status]=active&filters[category]=electronics
GET /products?page=2&pageSize=50&sort=-created_at
GET /products?after_key=eyJpZCI6MTIzfQ&limit=25

Response Envelope:
{
  "data": [...],
  "meta": {
    "pagination": {
      "page": 1,
      "pageSize": 50,
      "total": 1250,
      "hasMore": true
    }
  },
  "message": "Products retrieved successfully",
  "toast": false,
  "responseType": "success"
}
```

**Authentication and Authorization**

Authentication and authorization ensure secure access to API resources while maintaining appropriate access controls.

**Authentication methods:**
```
API Authentication Patterns:

  }
}
```

**Conflict Resolution Strategies**

Conflict resolution strategies handle data inconsistencies and synchronization conflicts in distributed systems.

**Conflict resolution patterns:**
```
Conflict Resolution Strategies:

Last-Write-Wins (LWW):
Scenario: Same product updated in two systems
System A: quantity = 100 (updated at 10:30:00)
System B: quantity = 95  (updated at 10:31:00)
Resolution: System B wins (later timestamp)

Implementation:
{
  "product_id": "prod_abc123",
  "quantity": 95,
  "last_updated": "2025-01-28T10:31:00Z",
  "updated_by": "system_b",
  "conflict_resolution": "last_write_wins"
}

Version-Based Resolution:
Scenario: Concurrent updates with version tracking
Current: {"quantity": 100, "version": 5}
Update A: {"quantity": 95, "version": 6}
Update B: {"quantity": 98, "version": 6}
Resolution: Conflict detected, manual resolution required

Implementation:
{
  "product_id": "prod_abc123",
  "current_version": 5,
  "conflicts": [
    {
      "source": "system_a",
      "proposed_quantity": 95,
      "proposed_version": 6,
      "timestamp": "2025-01-28T10:30:00Z"
    },
    {
      "source": "system_b",
      "proposed_quantity": 98,
      "proposed_version": 6,
      "timestamp": "2025-01-28T10:30:15Z"
    }
  ],
  "resolution_required": true
}

Business Rule Resolution:
Scenario: Inventory quantity conflicts
Rule: Never allow negative inventory
System A: quantity = 10
System B: quantity = -5
Resolution: Reject negative value, keep positive

Implementation:
{
  "product_id": "prod_abc123",
  "conflict_type": "business_rule_violation",
  "rule": "no_negative_inventory",
  "rejected_value": -5,
  "accepted_value": 10,
  "resolution": "business_rule_enforcement"
}

Manual Resolution Queue:
Scenario: Complex conflicts requiring human intervention
{
  "conflict_id": "conf_abc123",
  "conflict_type": "data_inconsistency",
  "product_id": "prod_def456",
  "conflicting_systems": ["erp", "wms", "ecommerce"],
  "values": {
    "erp": {"quantity": 100, "cost": 25.00},
    "wms": {"quantity": 95, "cost": 25.00},
    "ecommerce": {"quantity": 98, "cost": 24.50}
  },
  "created_at": "2025-01-28T10:30:00Z",
  "priority": "high",
  "assigned_to": "inventory_manager",
  "resolution_deadline": "2025-01-28T12:00:00Z"
}

Merge Strategies:
Additive Merge (for quantities):
System A: on_hand = 100, allocated = 20
System B: on_hand = 100, allocated = 25
Merged: on_hand = 100, allocated = 45 (sum allocations)

Field-Level Merge (for attributes):
System A: {name: "Widget A", price: 25.00, category: "electronics"}
System B: {name: "Widget A", price: 24.50, description: "Premium widget"}
Merged: {name: "Widget A", price: 24.50, category: "electronics", description: "Premium widget"}
```

## Error Handling and Resilience

Error handling and resilience patterns ensure robust integrations that gracefully handle failures and maintain system stability.

**Retry Strategies and Circuit Breakers**

Retry strategies and circuit breakers protect systems from cascading failures while maintaining service availability.

**Retry patterns:**
```
Retry Strategy Implementation:

Exponential Backoff:
Attempt 1: Immediate
Attempt 2: Wait 1 second
Attempt 3: Wait 2 seconds
Attempt 4: Wait 4 seconds
Attempt 5: Wait 8 seconds
Max attempts: 5

Implementation:
function exponentialBackoff(attempt) {
  const baseDelay = 1000; // 1 second
  const maxDelay = 30000; // 30 seconds
  const delay = Math.min(baseDelay * Math.pow(2, attempt - 1), maxDelay);
  return delay + Math.random() * 1000; // Add jitter
}

Retry Configuration:
{
  "retry_policy": {
    "max_attempts": 5,
    "base_delay_ms": 1000,
    "max_delay_ms": 30000,
    "backoff_multiplier": 2.0,
    "jitter": true,
    "retryable_errors": [
      "NETWORK_ERROR",
      "TIMEOUT",
      "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
      "INTERNAL_ERROR"
    ],
    "non_retryable_errors": [
      "AUTHENTICATION_FAILED",
      "VALIDATION_FAILED",
      "NOT_FOUND",
      "PERMISSION_DENIED"
    ]
  }
}

Linear Backoff:
Attempt 1: Immediate
Attempt 2: Wait 2 seconds
Attempt 3: Wait 4 seconds
Attempt 4: Wait 6 seconds
Attempt 5: Wait 8 seconds

Fixed Interval:
All retries: Wait 5 seconds between attempts
Use case: Predictable load patterns

Retry with Jitter:
Base delay: 2 seconds
Jitter: ±50% random variation
Actual delays: 1.2s, 2.8s, 1.6s, 2.4s
Purpose: Prevent thundering herd
```

**Circuit breaker patterns:**
```
Circuit Breaker Implementation:

Circuit States:
CLOSED (Normal Operation):
- Requests pass through normally
- Monitor failure rate and response times
- Track success/failure metrics

OPEN (Failing):
- All requests fail immediately
- No calls to downstream service
- Periodic health checks
- Automatic timeout to HALF_OPEN

HALF_OPEN (Testing):
- Limited requests allowed through
- Monitor success rate
- Return to CLOSED if successful
- Return to OPEN if failures continue

Configuration:
{
  "circuit_breaker": {
    "failure_threshold": 5,           // Failures before opening
    "failure_rate_threshold": 0.5,   // 50% failure rate
    "timeout_ms": 60000,              // 1 minute timeout
    "half_open_max_calls": 3,         // Test calls in half-open
    "half_open_success_threshold": 2, // Successes to close
    "monitoring_window_ms": 300000    // 5 minute window
  }
}

Circuit Breaker Response:
{
  "error": {
    "code": "CIRCUIT_BREAKER_OPEN",
    "message": "Service temporarily unavailable",
    "details": {
      "circuit_state": "OPEN",
      "failure_count": 8,
      "last_failure_at": "2025-01-28T10:25:00Z",
      "retry_after": "2025-01-28T10:26:00Z"
    }
  },
  "responseType": "error"
}

Fallback Strategies:
Cache Fallback:
- Return cached data when circuit is open
- Include staleness indicators
- Graceful degradation

Default Values:
- Return safe default values
- Indicate reduced functionality
- Maintain core operations

Alternative Service:
- Route to backup service
- Use read replicas
- Implement service mesh routing
```

**Idempotency and Transaction Safety**

Idempotency and transaction safety ensure reliable operations even with network failures and duplicate requests.

**Idempotency implementation:**
```
Idempotency Patterns:

Idempotency Keys:
Header: Idempotency-Key: idem_abc123def456
Purpose: Ensure at-most-once processing
Scope: Per endpoint and organization
TTL: 24 hours

Request Example:
POST /inventory/transactions
Idempotency-Key: idem_20250128_103000_001
{

**Transaction safety patterns:**
```
Transaction Safety Patterns:

Atomic Operations:
POST /inventory/transfers
{
  "source_location_id": "loc_abc123",
  "destination_location_id": "loc_def456",
  "product_id": "prod_ghi789",
  "quantity": {"value": 50, "uom": "EACH"}
}

Atomic Processing:
1. Validate source inventory
2. Create outbound transaction
3. Create inbound transaction
4. Update inventory balances
5. Commit all changes or rollback

Two-Phase Commit:
Phase 1 - Prepare:
POST /inventory/transactions/prepare
{
  "transaction_id": "txn_abc123",
  "operations": [
    {
      "type": "debit",
      "location_id": "loc_abc123",
      "product_id": "prod_def456",
      "quantity": {"value": 50, "uom": "EACH"}
    },
    {
      "type": "credit",
      "location_id": "loc_ghi789",
      "product_id": "prod_def456",
      "quantity": {"value": 50, "uom": "EACH"}
    }
  ]
}

Response:
{
  "transaction_id": "txn_abc123",
  "status": "prepared",
  "expires_at": "2025-01-28T10:35:00Z"
}

Phase 2 - Commit:
POST /inventory/transactions/txn_abc123/commit

Response:
{
  "transaction_id": "txn_abc123",
  "status": "committed",
  "completed_at": "2025-01-28T10:30:00Z"
}

Saga Pattern:
Long-running transaction with compensation
{
  "saga_id": "saga_abc123",
  "steps": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "action": "reserve_inventory",
      "compensation": "release_reservation"
    },
    {
      "step": 2,
      "action": "create_shipment",
      "compensation": "cancel_shipment"
    },
    {
      "step": 3,
      "action": "charge_payment",
      "compensation": "refund_payment"
    }
  ]
}

Compensation Example:
If step 3 fails, execute compensations:
1. Refund payment (not needed - step failed)
2. Cancel shipment
3. Release inventory reservation

Optimistic Locking:
GET /products/prod_abc123
{
  "id": "prod_abc123",
  "name": "Widget",
  "quantity": 100,
  "version": 5,
  "updated_at": "2025-01-28T10:00:00Z"
}

PUT /products/prod_abc123
If-Match: "version-5"
{
  "name": "Updated Widget",
  "quantity": 95,
  "version": 6
}

Success (200) or Conflict (409) if version changed
```

```
API Performance Analysis:

Current Performance Metrics:
Endpoint Performance (Last 24h):
GET /products:
- Avg response time: 245ms
- 95th percentile: 450ms
- 99th percentile: 890ms
- Request volume: 125,000
- Cache hit rate: 67%

GET /inventory/locations/{id}/products:
- Avg response time: 180ms
- 95th percentile: 320ms
- 99th percentile: 650ms
- Request volume: 89,000
- Cache hit rate: 78%

POST /inventory/transactions:
- Avg response time: 95ms
- 95th percentile: 150ms
- 99th percentile: 280ms
- Request volume: 45,000
- Success rate: 99.8%

Performance Bottlenecks:
1. Product search queries: Complex filtering
2. Inventory aggregations: Cross-location calculations
3. Real-time availability: Multiple system checks
4. Report generation: Large data sets

Caching Strategy Implementation:
Redis Cache Configuration:
{
  "cache_policies": {
    "product_catalog": {
      "ttl": 3600,        // 1 hour
      "strategy": "write_through",

      "events": ["inventory.updated"]
    },
    "location_data": {
      "ttl": 7200,        // 2 hours
      "strategy": "lazy_loading",
      "invalidation": "manual",
      "refresh_ahead": true
    }
  }
}

Cache Implementation:
GET /products?category=electronics&status=active

Cache Key: products:category:electronics:status:active:page:1
Cache Value:
{
  "data": [...],
  "cached_at": "2025-01-28T15:00:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2025-01-28T16:00:00Z",
  "cache_version": "v1.2"
}

Cache Invalidation:
Event: product.updated
Action: Invalidate tags ["products", "pricing"]
Affected Keys:
- products:*
- pricing:*
- search:*

Database Query Optimization:
Original Query (245ms avg):
SELECT p.*, i.quantity, i.available
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN inventory i ON p.id = i.product_id
WHERE p.category = 'electronics'
  AND p.status = 'active'
  AND i.location_id IN (...)
ORDER BY p.name

Optimized Query (89ms avg):
SELECT p.id, p.sku, p.name, p.status,
       COALESCE(SUM(i.quantity), 0) as total_quantity,
       COALESCE(SUM(i.available), 0) as total_available
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN inventory_summary i ON p.id = i.product_id
WHERE p.category_id = 5  -- Pre-resolved category ID
  AND p.status = 1       -- Enum value
  AND (i.location_group = 'retail' OR i.location_group IS NULL)
GROUP BY p.id, p.sku, p.name, p.status
ORDER BY p.name

Optimization Results:
- Response time: 245ms → 89ms (64% improvement)
- Database load: 45% reduction
- Cache hit rate: 67% → 85%
- Concurrent requests: +40% capacity
