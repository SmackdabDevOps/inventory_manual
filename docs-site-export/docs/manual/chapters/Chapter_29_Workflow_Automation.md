# Chapter 29: Workflow Automation

**Contract Reference:** `shared/hooks.yaml`, `shared/schemas/envelope.yaml`, Business Rules Framework

## Making Your Business Run Itself

Picture this: Your inventory levels drop below reorder points and purchase orders are automatically created with the best suppliers. Customer orders trigger automatic allocation, picking, and shipping workflows. Quality issues automatically initiate return processes and supplier notifications. Period-end closing procedures execute systematically with automatic validations and approvals. Your team focuses on strategic decisions while routine operations run themselves. How do you create intelligent workflows that handle complex business processes automatically while maintaining control and visibility?

This is where workflow automation comes in. Workflow automation transforms manual, error-prone processes into systematic, reliable, and intelligent operations that execute consistently while adapting to changing conditions. It's the difference between reactive management and proactive optimization.

But workflow automation is more than just scripting tasks—it involves process design and modeling, event-driven triggers, decision logic and rules, and monitoring and optimization. Poor automation creates rigid, brittle processes that break under changing conditions. Excellent automation creates adaptive, intelligent systems that improve operations while reducing costs and errors.

Understanding how to design and implement workflow automation effectively—from simple triggers through complex orchestrations—is essential for operational excellence and competitive advantage. This chapter will show you how to master workflow automation as both an operational capability and a strategic differentiator.

## Process Design and Modeling

Process design and modeling establish the foundation for effective workflow automation by defining clear, systematic approaches to business operations.

**Business Process Analysis**

Business process analysis identifies automation opportunities and designs optimal workflows that balance efficiency, reliability, and flexibility.

**Process analysis framework:**
```
Business Process Analysis Framework:

Process Identification:
Core Inventory Processes:
1. Procurement Workflows
   - Demand detection → Supplier selection → PO creation → Approval → Fulfillment
   - Triggers: Reorder points, forecasts, manual requests
   - Decisions: Supplier selection, quantity optimization, approval routing

2. Order Fulfillment Workflows
   - Order receipt → Allocation → Picking → Packing → Shipping → Delivery
   - Triggers: Customer orders, allocation requests
   - Decisions: Inventory allocation, shipping methods, delivery routing

3. Inventory Management Workflows
   - Receipt → Quality check → Put-away → Cycle counting → Adjustments
   - Triggers: Shipment arrivals, count schedules, variance detection
   - Decisions: Quality approval, location assignment, adjustment authorization

4. Returns Processing Workflows
   - Return request → Authorization → Receipt → Inspection → Disposition
   - Triggers: Customer requests, quality issues, warranty claims
   - Decisions: Return authorization, refund/replacement, inventory disposition

Process Mapping:

```

**Workflow Design Patterns**

Workflow design patterns provide proven approaches to common automation scenarios and business requirements.

**Common workflow patterns:**
```
Workflow Design Patterns:

Sequential Workflow:
Pattern: Linear sequence of steps
Use Case: Standard order processing
Example:
Order Received → Validate → Allocate → Pick → Pack → Ship → Confirm

Parallel Workflow:
Pattern: Concurrent execution of independent tasks
Use Case: Multi-location inventory check
Example:
Inventory Request → [Check Warehouse A, Check Warehouse B, Check Store C] → Consolidate Results

Conditional Workflow:
Pattern: Different paths based on conditions
Use Case: Approval routing based on value
Example:
Purchase Request → [Value < $1000: Auto-approve, Value > $1000: Manager approval, Value > $10000: Executive approval]

Loop Workflow:
Pattern: Repeated execution until condition met
Use Case: Supplier selection with fallbacks
Example:
Check Primary Supplier → [Available: Create PO, Not Available: Check Next Supplier] → Repeat until found

Event-Driven Workflow:
Pattern: Triggered by external events
Use Case: Automatic reordering
Example:
Inventory Level Event → Check Reorder Point → Calculate Order Quantity → Create Purchase Order

Compensation Workflow:
Pattern: Rollback actions on failure
Use Case: Failed payment processing
Example:
Reserve Inventory → Process Payment → [Success: Ship Order, Failure: Release Inventory + Notify Customer]

Human-in-the-Loop Workflow:
Pattern: Automated with manual intervention points
Use Case: Quality inspection
Example:
Receive Goods → Auto-check Documentation → [Pass: Auto-approve, Fail: Human inspection] → Update Status

State Machine Workflow:
Pattern: State transitions based on events
Use Case: Order lifecycle management
Example:
States: [Pending, Confirmed, Allocated, Picked, Shipped, Delivered]
Transitions: Confirm order, Allocate inventory, Pick items, Ship package, Confirm delivery
```

2. Process payment (compensate: refund payment)
3. Create shipment (compensate: cancel shipment)
4. Update customer (compensate: notify cancellation)

Workflow State Management:
State Persistence:
