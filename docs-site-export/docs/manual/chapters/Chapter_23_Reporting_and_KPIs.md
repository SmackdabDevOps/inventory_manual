# Chapter 23: Reporting and KPIs

**Contract Reference:** `operations/analytics/paths/aging-core.yaml`, `operations/analytics/paths/turnover-core.yaml`

## Communicating Performance Through Reports

Picture this: Your CEO asks for a summary of inventory performance for the board meeting tomorrow. Your CFO needs detailed aging reports for the quarterly review. Your operations manager wants daily KPI updates to track improvement initiatives. Each stakeholder needs different information, in different formats, at different frequencies. How do you provide consistent, accurate, and actionable reporting that meets everyone's needs?

This is where systematic reporting and KPI management come in. Reporting transforms analytics into communication tools that inform stakeholders, track progress, and drive accountability. It's the difference between having insights and effectively communicating those insights to drive action.

But reporting is more than just generating documents—it's about understanding audience needs, presenting information clearly, ensuring data accuracy, and creating accountability for performance. Poor reporting leads to confusion, misaligned priorities, and missed opportunities. Excellent reporting creates alignment, drives performance, and enables informed decision-making at all levels.

Understanding how to design and manage reporting systems effectively—from operational dashboards through executive summaries—is essential for organizational alignment and performance management. This chapter will show you how to master reporting as both a communication tool and a management system.
