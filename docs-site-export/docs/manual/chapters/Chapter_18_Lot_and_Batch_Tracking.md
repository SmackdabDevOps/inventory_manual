# Chapter 18: Lot and Batch Tracking

**Contract Reference:** `operations/tracking/paths/lot-core.yaml`

## Managing Products by the Batch

Picture this: You receive a call from the FDA saying there's a potential contamination issue with a specific production batch of pharmaceutical ingredients you distributed last month. You need to identify every customer who received products from that batch, how much they received, and where those products are now. Or imagine discovering that a batch of electronic components has a higher-than-normal failure rate, and you need to proactively contact customers before they experience problems. How do you track products by production batch or lot?

This is where lot and batch tracking comes in. Lot tracking transforms inventory management from individual unit focus to group-level traceability that balances control with efficiency. It's the difference between tracking every single pill and tracking the batch that contains thousands of pills with shared characteristics.

But lot tracking is more than just grouping products—it's about quality control, expiration management, recall efficiency, and regulatory compliance. Poor lot tracking leads to compliance failures, quality issues, inefficient recalls, and customer safety risks. Excellent lot tracking creates competitive advantages through quality assurance, efficient operations, and regulatory confidence.

Understanding how to implement and manage lot and batch tracking effectively—from initial lot creation through complete lifecycle management—is essential for businesses dealing with manufactured goods, consumables, or regulated products. This chapter will show you how to master lot tracking as both an operational necessity and a quality assurance tool.

## Lot Tracking Fundamentals

Lot and batch tracking provides group-level identification and lifecycle management for products sharing common characteristics or production origins.

**When to Use Lot Tracking**

Lot tracking is ideal for products where group-level traceability provides optimal balance of control and operational efficiency.

**Products requiring lot tracking:**
- **Manufactured goods** - Products made in production runs or batches
- **Consumable products** - Items with expiration dates or shelf life
- **Raw materials** - Ingredients or components used in production
- **Pharmaceutical products** - Drugs, supplements, medical supplies
- **Food products** - Items requiring freshness and safety tracking
- **Chemical products** - Materials with batch-specific properties

**Lot tracking benefits:**
- **Quality control** - Identify and isolate quality issues by batch
- **Expiration management** - Track shelf life and rotation requirements
- **Recall efficiency** - Quickly identify affected products and customers
- **Regulatory compliance** - Meet traceability requirements efficiently
- **Cost effectiveness** - Group-level tracking reduces administrative overhead
- **Supply chain visibility** - Track products through distribution channels

**Example lot tracking decision:**
```

- Tracking points: Production, receipt, allocation, shipment
- Expiration tracking: Manufacture date + 24 months
- FIFO rotation: Automatic oldest-first allocation
```

**Listing Lots and Batches**

Lot lists provide visibility into all tracked batches with their current status, quantities, and expiration information.

**Lot list information:**
- **Lot number** - Unique identifier for the batch
- **Product details** - What the lot contains
- **Quantities** - Total, available, allocated, shipped
- **Dates** - Manufacture, receipt, expiration
- **Status** - Released, quarantine, expired, recalled
- **Location** - Where the lot is stored

**Lot listing example:**
```

**Creating Lot Records**

Lot record creation establishes tracking for new batches entering your inventory system.

**Lot creation triggers:**
- **Production completion** - Finished goods from manufacturing
- **Supplier receipts** - Batches received from vendors
- **Repackaging operations** - Creating new lots from existing inventory
- **Quality release** - Batches cleared for distribution
- **Import receipts** - International shipments with batch documentation

**Lot creation process:**
1. **Identify the batch** - Production run or supplier lot information
2. **Assign lot number** - Follow established numbering scheme
3. **Record batch details** - Quantities, dates, specifications
4. **Set initial status** - Released, quarantine, or pending
5. **Document source** - Manufacturing or supplier information
6. **Create system record** - Enter into tracking system

**Expiration and FIFO Management**

Expiration management ensures products are used in proper rotation and prevents distribution of expired goods.

**FIFO (First In, First Out) principles:**
- **Oldest lots ship first** - Automatic allocation by expiration date
- **Expiration monitoring** - Alerts for approaching expiration
- **Rotation enforcement** - System prevents newer lot allocation when older lots available
- **Exception handling** - Override procedures for special circumstances
- **Waste minimization** - Proactive management to reduce expired inventory

**Expiration management process:**
1. **Monitor expiration dates** - Daily review of approaching expirations
2. **Generate alerts** - Notify stakeholders of expiring lots
3. **Prioritize allocation** - Ensure oldest lots are allocated first
4. **Coordinate with sales** - Promote expiring inventory
5. **Manage exceptions** - Handle special customer requirements
6. **Dispose expired inventory** - Proper disposal of unusable products

**Example FIFO management:**
```

## Common Questions & Troubleshooting

### "What's the difference between lot tracking and serial tracking?"

**Lot tracking** manages groups of products, **serial tracking** manages individual units:

**Lot Tracking**:
- Group-level identification
- Batch manufacturing or receipt
- Shared characteristics (expiration, quality)
- Cost-effective for high-volume products
- FIFO rotation management

**Serial Tracking**:
- Individual unit identification
- Unique characteristics per unit
- Individual warranties and service
- Higher administrative cost
- Detailed lifecycle tracking

Choose based on product value, regulatory requirements, and business needs.

### "How do I handle products that require both lot and serial tracking?"

Some products benefit from both tracking methods:

**Implementation approach**:
- **Lot level** - Production batch, expiration, quality
- **Serial level** - Individual unit within the lot
- **Hierarchy** - Serial numbers belong to specific lots
- **Tracking** - Both lot and serial information maintained

**Example**: Medical devices with batch quality control and individual unit warranties.

### "What if I receive products with different expiration dates in the same shipment?"

Handle mixed expiration dates systematically:

1. **Separate by expiration** - Create different lots for different dates
2. **Document clearly** - Record all expiration dates received
3. **FIFO by expiration** - Allocate oldest expiration first
4. **Label distinctly** - Ensure clear identification
5. **Track separately** - Maintain separate lot records

Never mix different expiration dates in the same lot.

### "How do I manage lot rotation (FIFO) effectively?"

Implement systematic FIFO management:

**System controls**:
- Automatic allocation by expiration date
- Override controls for exceptions
- Expiration alerts and warnings
- Regular rotation audits

**Physical controls**:
- Clear date labeling
- Organized storage by expiration
- Regular inventory rotation
- Staff training on FIFO principles

**Monitoring**:
- Track rotation compliance
- Monitor expired inventory
- Analyze allocation patterns
- Identify improvement opportunities

### "What should I do when a lot fails quality testing?"

Handle quality failures systematically:

1. **Immediate quarantine** - Stop all shipments and allocations
2. **Investigation** - Determine root cause and scope
3. **Customer notification** - Contact affected customers
4. **Disposition decision** - Rework, return, or dispose
5. **Process improvement** - Prevent future occurrences

Document everything for regulatory compliance and learning.

### "How do I handle customer requests for specific lot numbers?"

Manage lot-specific requests carefully:

**Valid reasons**:
- Regulatory requirements
- Quality consistency needs
- Previous performance history
- Technical compatibility

**Process**:
- Verify lot availability and status
- Check expiration and quality
- Document customer requirement
- Override FIFO if necessary (with approval)
- Maintain audit trail of exceptions

Balance customer needs with inventory rotation requirements.

### "What if I discover inventory without lot identification?"

Handle unidentified inventory systematically:

1. **Quarantine immediately** - Don't use until identified
2. **Research history** - Check receiving records and documentation
3. **Physical inspection** - Look for date codes or markings
4. **Quality testing** - Verify product meets specifications
5. **Create lot record** - Assign appropriate lot number
6. **Document assumptions** - Record how lot was determined

When in doubt, treat as expired or quarantine for safety.

### "How long should I keep lot records?"

Retention periods depend on regulatory and business requirements:

**Typical retention periods**:
- **Food products**: 2-3 years beyond expiration
- **Pharmaceuticals**: 5-7 years beyond expiration
- **Industrial products**: 3-5 years beyond expiration
- **Regulated industries**: Per specific regulations

Check industry-specific requirements and maintain longer if needed for liability protection.

### "How do I handle lot recalls efficiently?"

Prepare for recalls with systematic procedures:

**Preparation**:
- Maintain complete traceability records
- Document all customers and quantities
- Establish communication procedures
- Train staff on recall processes

**Execution**:
- Identify affected lots quickly
- Contact all affected customers
- Coordinate product retrieval
- Document all actions taken
- Report to regulatory authorities

Speed and accuracy are critical for effective recalls.

### "What reports should I generate for lot management?"

Key reports for different purposes:

**Operational Reports**:
- Lot inventory by expiration date
- FIFO allocation compliance
- Expiration alerts and warnings

**Quality Reports**:
- Lot quality history
- Customer complaint analysis
- Quality trend analysis

**Regulatory Reports**:
- Lot traceability records
- Recall impact analysis
- Compliance documentation

**Management Reports**:
- Inventory aging analysis
- Rotation efficiency metrics
- Cost impact of expired inventory

Generate reports regularly and use them to drive improvements.

**Key takeaways:**

**Group-level tracking optimizes efficiency** — Managing products by batch or lot provides necessary traceability while maintaining operational efficiency for high-volume products.

**FIFO rotation prevents waste** — Systematic first-in, first-out allocation ensures products are used before expiration, minimizing waste and maximizing value.

**Quality control benefits from batch visibility** — Lot-level tracking enables rapid identification and isolation of quality issues, protecting customers and minimizing impact.

**Expiration management ensures safety** — Systematic tracking of manufacture and expiration dates prevents distribution of expired products and ensures customer safety.

**Recall efficiency protects reputation** — Complete lot traceability enables rapid, targeted recalls that minimize impact while demonstrating responsibility and control.

**Regulatory compliance reduces risk** — Proper lot documentation and traceability meet regulatory requirements and support audit activities across industries.

**Status management reflects reality** — Systematic status tracking ensures accurate information about lot condition, availability, and regulatory state throughout the lifecycle.

**History tracking enables improvement** — Complete event logs support quality investigations, process improvements, and customer service excellence.

**Integration amplifies value** — Connecting lot tracking with quality, sales, and compliance systems creates operational synergies and strategic advantages.

**Cost-effective traceability** — Lot tracking provides necessary traceability at lower administrative cost than individual unit tracking for appropriate products.

Lot and batch tracking is more than just inventory management—it's a quality assurance and risk management capability that enables regulatory compliance while optimizing operational efficiency. When implemented effectively, it becomes a competitive advantage that builds customer trust and operational excellence.

Together with serial number tracking from the previous chapter, lot tracking provides complete traceability solutions that can be tailored to any product mix and business requirement. The combination enables optimal balance of control, efficiency, and compliance across your entire product portfolio.
